			<i><b>Google LLC[5]</b></i> is an &nbsp &nbsp  American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products,
			which include online advertising<br> technologies, search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware.
			Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D.<br> students at Stanford University, California.
			Together, they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through<br> supervoting stock.
			They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998.
			An Initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004,<br> and Google moved to its new headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.
 			In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its<br> various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. 
			Google, Alphabet's leading subsidiary, will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet<br> interests. 
			Upon completion of the restructure, Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet.
